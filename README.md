- [Repo structure](#repo-structure)

## Summary

This competition involves solving the task of predicting salaries based on job descriptions. It is part of the bootcamp "Second Step in NLP" organized by the Faculty of Computer Science of the Higher School of Economics (HSE).

To approach this task, I perform feature engineering and compare linear regression model with gradient-boosted decision tree model (Catboost).


## Repo structure

The project has the following structure:
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks:
- `data/`: input data and sample prediction file
